# Just another cyber-securty blog? 

Hello! My name is Clara, and I am a computer engineer who recently started my journey as a cyber-security consultant. It is an exciting, and rapidly changing, industry with a lot of things to learn. And I have noticed that if I write what I learn down in a way that's understandable to others, I also remember what I learn in a larger extent.
Therefore, I have decided to write my learnings and thoughts in cyber-security down in a blog! I will cover everything that I have found interesting or useful in my cyber-security career. 

So yes, I guess this is just another cyber-security blog...

I hope you will enjoy it!
